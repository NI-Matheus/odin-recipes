        <p>
            "This was a hit with my family," says community member Janice Nagle. 
            "I made it as the recipe is written. The only change I made was to 
            add a half cup of sweet Vidalia onion with the bell pepper. I also 
            served salsa and sour cream on the side. This recipe seems easy to
            change up. I think bacon, Cheddar cheese, and cooked potatoes 
            could also work in this recipe."

                    Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ham and red bell pepper;
                    cook and stir until slightly softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add eggs; cook, 
                    stirring gently, until scrambled and set, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.

                    Wipe out skillet and place 1 flour tortilla on the bottom. Place 3 slices of
                    mozzarella cheese on top. Top with egg mixture and remaining 3 slices mozzarella
                    cheese. Cover with second tortilla. Cook until golden, about 1 minute. Flip and 
                    continue cooking until second side is golden, about 1 minute more.
