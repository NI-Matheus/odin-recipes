        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a recipe that I made up after being disappointed by the 
            Dunkin' Donuts® breakfast quesadilla. These quesadillas are satisfying 
            and filling, and a good way to start your day. I make these the night 
            before for my husband. He re-warms them in the microwave or the toaster
            oven and they are as good as freshly made. They can also be made in 
            advance and frozen for future breakfasts.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Beat 2 eggs with 1 1/2 tablespoons milk in a bowl.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a 6-inch frying pan over medium heat. 
                    Add bell pepper and onion and cook until onion is translucent,
                    about 5 minutes. Remove 1/2 the mixture and set aside in a bowl.

                    Pour egg mixture and 1/2 vegetable mixture into the skillet. 
                    Tilt the pan, gently push one side of the egg, without breaking
                    it, away from the side of the pan, and let the uncooked egg run 
                    onto the pan. Repeat with all four sides of the egg, cooking 
                    until bottom is set, about 2 minutes. Flip over and cook until
                    bottom is slightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes more.

                    Slide omelet onto a tortilla, then slide tortilla back onto the pan.
                    Place 1 slice of cheese onto the omelet and top with another tortilla. 
                    Cook until bottom is browned, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown opposite 
                    side, about 1 minute more. Slide quesadilla onto a plate and cut into 
                    4 sections.

                    Beat remaining 2 eggs and 1 1/2 tablespoons milk together in a bowl. 
                    Grease the same pan with the second teaspoon of butter. Repeat steps 
                    3-4 with the reserved vegetables and the remaining cheese and tortillas.
